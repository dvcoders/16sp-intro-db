# An Example

- Problem: storing information about 70,000 lines worth of DVC courses in a text file is inefficient, hard to manage, and slow at insertion, updating, and retrieval

- Parsing the file, then storing the information in data structures such as hash tables is not great, becuase all that information is stored in RAM

- Facebook stores 300 PB of data, an impossible amount to store in RAM

- Updating information requires writing to the file

- Many applications may want to access the data at one time
